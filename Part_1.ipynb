    "## Part 1 Correlation of Mean Annual Temperature with Altitude in Bavaria\n",
    "In the first lectures we analysed the annual temperature in NRW by means of long time series. The observed temperature increase particularly in the last decade is most likely an indication of climate. We also observed that the station \"Kahler Asten\" shows systematic lower temperatures than other stations. We presumed this being an effect of decreasing temperature with topographic height, since \"Kahler Asten\" is among the highest points in NRW. \n",
    "\n",
    "Verify this hypothesis by means of data in Bavaria. This federal state reveals the broadest range of topographic heights, from 100m to more than 2800m above Normal-Null (NN). "
