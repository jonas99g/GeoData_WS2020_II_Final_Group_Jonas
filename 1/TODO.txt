1.
Plot the annual mean temperatures of years 2017, 2018, and 2019 versus altitude for the DWD stations in Bavaria. At first use the altitudes from the station description file `KL_Jahreswerte_Beschreibung_Stationen.txt` for the data set `/annual/kl/historical/`.

2.
Compare the original altitudes from the DWD station file to the heights derived from the DTM. Where and why are the strongest deviations? 

3.
Plot the mean annual temperatures versus the DTM heights for the DWD stations in Bavaria. Do you find a ways to perform a linear regression to the data with numpy? What is the temperature gradient, i.e. the slope of the regression line in units K/m or °C/m?

DWD hourly precipitation data Time series

THe processing chain consisting of Python code and QGIS project to create the video is found in the Git folder 
(../gdms0350_DWD_Stations_and_TS_for_TM_soln/)

Produce your own video for BAVARIA** by applying the processing chain to a period of 40 days covering an interesting rain event in 2017. You have to use the historical hourly precipitation data in 2017**. Find an interesting sequence of rain events first by plotting a few time series.

Compare NDVI for Two Different Years

In the last lectures, we talked about remote sensing and how we could use satellite data (Sentinel-2) to obtain information about the earth’s surface based on the spectral properties (i.e. spectral reflectance) of materials such as vegetation and soil without being in contact with the surface itself. We discussed how normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used to assess the plant´s ability to absorb solar radiation and use this to characterize the plant’s health.
Your task is to analyse the NDVI in the summer periods (May-June) of the years 2018 and 2019 in your own regions of interest (ROI). Define your own ROIs by creating polygons delineating areas with one landuse class per polygon. You should create at least one polygon for each of the following landuse classes:
* Forest
* Water
* Crop Field
* Grassland (not artificially irrigated)
* Urban Area

To save time we identified five Sentinel products atmospherically corrected (Level 2A) and with low cloud coverage. Select (at least) two appropriate satellite scenes from the following list covering both years 2018 and 2019. Download and store them in an appropriate folder.

What does the difference of NDVI tell you for each polygon? Is NDVI enough to classify the different landuses?  
Notice that one polygon might contain more than one NDVI value (more than 1 pixel). So in order to estimate the NDVI for the whole area, you can calculate the statistical mean. 
(Optional task) Try calculating a different spectral index for the same polygons. For which polygons is this spectral index appropriate? Compare this with your NDVI results. 

ATTENTION: Some of you have already chosen a different approach. This is totally acceptable!
 We just want you to analyse Sentinel-2 images with respect to NDVI and its changes over time (here: only two years) as well as to reflect power and limitations of remote sensing.

Digitization: Burial Mounds in Uedemer Hochwald

<img src="images/Burial_Mounds.png" alt="Burial Mounds Map" width="600" border="10" /><br>
*Fig.: Burial mounds in Uedemer Hochwald.*

South west of the village Marienbaum (belongs to Xanten municipality) is the forest "Uedemer Hochwald" in which many burial mounds (German: Hügelgrab (sg.), Hügelgräber (pl.)) from our ancestors of the Hallstatt period (a Celtic culture
 between 850 and 450 BCE) can be found. The above picture shows a map section with some of the burial mounds indicated as grey dots. 
 
**Task 1:** <br> 
Georeference this picture by means of the QGIS Georeferencer together with the topographic map 1:10000 already imported from a WMS in the QGIS project `gdms0000_Burial_Mounds_Uedem_V001.qgz`. Use crossing forest trails, crossroads, road junctions and other features you can identify as land marks (aka ground control points, GCP) with known coordinates (can be read from the QGIS map canvas). Use EPSG:25832. 
 
**Task 2:** <br> 
Load the DTM hillshade model provided as a WMS. The German word for hillshade is "Schummerung". Plot the georeferenced map partly transparent on top of the hillshade model. What do you observe? How good is the map section showing the burial mounds? 
 
**Task 3:** <br> 
Load the DTM located in the project folder. Create your own hillshade model from it. Follow this QGIS video tutorial:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK9aBRVJdRo

**Task 4:** <br> 
Use the DTM and measure the typical mound heights above ground (niot above sealevel!). What is their typical elvation above ground?

**Task 5:** <br> 
Study the hillshade model in direction East-North-East of the burial mounds area and search for regular structures which are not paths. What do you observe? Do you have a guess about the origin of these patterns? Choose at least one of the structures and digitize it and save it as a geopackage.
